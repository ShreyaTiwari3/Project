The "LMS" has been developed to override the 
problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is 
supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by this 
existing system. Moreover this system is designed for the particular need of 
the institution to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner. The 
application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. 
It also provides error message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge 
is needed for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it proves it is user friendly. Leave Management System, as described above, can lead to error 
free, secure, reliable and fast management system for applying, getting 
information and retrieval of leave.
